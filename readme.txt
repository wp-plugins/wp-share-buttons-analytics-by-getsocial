== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<h4> What is a custom action button? </h4>
Custom action buttons are elements placed in your website that, when clicked, will create and automatically post contextualized facebook stories in your users timelines.

<h4> Which data will I get from your analytics? </h4>
You'll have access to data regarding users, visits, shares and items (this can be products, news articles, blog posts, etc). You can even download the whole data set generated by GetSocial.

<h4> What is social influence analysis?</h4>
Our influence analysis allows our customers to understand how their website is being impacted per user, per item or per share. This means that it's simple to know, for instance, which user brought more new users into your website, which item brought in more pageviews or which share type generated more unique visitors

<h4> Why should I use these buttons instead of facebook buttons? </h4>
Today, facebook buttons are buttons with counters. The data and value you get from them are purely shares. However, you don’t know who’s sharing, what’s their behavior, you just know that 231 people shared something. GetSocial enables your users to express themselves in a unique way (defined by you) in a cramped sharing market and provides you an easy way to create and deploy your own buttons as well as social analytics that give you new info about your business.
