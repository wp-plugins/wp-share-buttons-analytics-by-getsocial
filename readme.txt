**Do you have a visit limit for my website?**

Yes. As every new website that registers with GetSocial is also a new cost for us, we must regulate the number of visitors for the websites who use us. However, visits limits change according to your plan.


**FREE Plan﻿:** If you're using our free plan, your limit is 50,000 visits per month. Once you reach this limit you'll be notified via email. If you don't upgrade to our PRO plan, we'll stop the service to your website. This means that all the apps you have installed will become inactive.

﻿**PRO Plan﻿:** Our customers have a higher limit and can get up to 1,000,000 visits per month. If you reach this limit as a PRO user you'll be also notified but ﻿we won't stop serving our apps into your website﻿. However, we'll add a second subscription to your account.

**How much will I pay in the PRO plan with 5 million visits?**

We sell our extra visits traffic packages at an extra $9/month per million visits. In this case, your PRO plan gives you the first million visits so you'll only need to buy 4 extra traffic packages. Your subscription cost will be $9 (PRO) + 4x $9 (visits), so $45/month.

**What is the Copy Paste Share Tracking?**

If you imagine the last times you shared something, it's probable that you haven't done so by clicking on a share button. If you're sharing a video to a friend or sending a link via email, you're sharing something and normally that doesn't get measured.

If you imagine the last times you shared something, it's probable that you haven't done so by clicking on a share button. If you're sharing a video to a friend or sending a link via email, you're sharing something and normally that doesn't get measured.

There’s an article on our knowledge base about this: <a href="http://feedback.getsocial.io/knowledgebase/articles/566541-can-i-exclude-apps-from-specific-pages">Can I exclude apps from specific pages?</a>
