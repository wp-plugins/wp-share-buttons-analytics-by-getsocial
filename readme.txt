== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is GetSocial?**

GetSocial is a software as a service that helps websites owners understand how social sharing drives their traffic and conversions. We provide a social media app store for all your needs, from awareness to conversion.

**How do I install GetSocial?**

We've made our best to make the installation process as seamless as it can be. If you created an account through our website, you'll be asked to place a bit of code on your website, just like Google Analytics or any other similar service. If you are familiar with it, you can use Google Tag Manager for easily do this. After installing our snippet of code, you'll have access to some 1-click install apps on our app store. If you’re using our Wordpress social sharing plugin good news: no code is required. Install all the apps with a click on our app store.

**What if I don’t know how to handle code?**

If you're not confortable around code and if we've failed to help you with our tutorials, we strongly recommend using one of our plugins. We've developed a social sharing plugin focused on content, specifically on Wordpress websites which you can download at: <a href="http://goo.gl/bdgOLN”></a>. We have also developed a social sharing plugin for eCommerce websites using Shopify as their platform. You can get our app here: <a href="http://goo.gl/4R82PS”></a>.

**Do you have a visit limit for my website?**

Yes. The plans above (Free, Pro, Premium) are available for websites with less then 1 million visits per month. A visit is the period time a user is actively engaged on areas of your website where our share buttons are available. If your traffic is above 1M per month please request a quote from us. Pricing goes from 9$/month ( Pro Plan ) to 99$/month ( Premium Plan ).

**What is included in the free plan?**

The free plan has a set of social media tools that can help you increase your traffic and conversions. You'll have access to our social sharing bars (horizontal, floating and native) and also to dark social sharing tracking. You can also create your own conversions to see how social is driving your business. Included in the free package is also our basic social analytics panel. This will give you a brief understanding on how many visits and shares you have. We then ananlyze how many visits (leads) those shares generated. You can also see the top 3 users, posts and social networks.

**What is different about GetSocial to other plugins and tools?**

From the feedback we've been receiving from our thousands of users, people join GetSocial for its design, easy installation and in-depth analytics. Our easy to user interface allows you to install our social media tools with no code required in just seconds, it's that easy. You also gain a simple to read dashboard with social analytics about your website.

**What is the Address Bar Tracking?**

If you imagine the last times you shared something, it's probable that you haven't done so by clicking on a share button. If you're sharing a video to a friend or sending a link via email, you're sharing something and normally that doesn't get measured. What happens is that you'll have these people being identified as 'direct' traffic to your website. They're not. The Address Bar feature allows you to track dark social sharing, which is sharing via alternative methods such as Copy&Paste, chats and link sharing in general.

**What's the difference between Basic Social Analytics & Advanced Social Analytics?**

In the Free and Pro plans you have access to a basic set of analytics. Like mentioned in the question 'What is included in the free plan?' we provide you with an overview of your sharing activity, namely top 3 users, posts and social networks. By subscribing the Premium plan, you'll have access to more thoroguh stats about your users, posts and networks. You'll be able to understand which of your users are sharing and how those shares are generating traffic and conversions to your website. You'll also be able to know which posts/articles are trending and being most shared.

**What is the difference between the Free Plan and the Pro Plan?**

The Free and Pro plans differ in the access to certain features. By subscribing to our Pro Plan you'll be able to (1) use our Custom Actions feature. Custom actions allow you to provide alternative sharing methods to your readers. These actions can be 'Love', 'Dislike', 'Agree' or any of the 50+ actions we have arranged for your website. Secondly, you'll be able to include beautifully designed social sharing buttons for your mobile readers. This allows them to have a great reading experience while providing them the ability to share the content they love. Thirdly, all GetSocial branding becomes optional and you're free to remove it from your sharing bars.

**What is the difference between the Free/Pro Plan and the Premium Plan?**

The Pro and Premium plans differ in the access to certain features and also in the depth of our analytics section. Premium users are able to track their users in an identified way. This means that instead of knowing that someone made 50 shares, they know Mark has performed those 50 shares. Premium users also get access to a GetSocial tool that allows them to track their competitors' sharing perfomance. An usage example would be a newspaper trying to know which pieces of content are trending in their country/industry, in real time.

**How do I upgrade and pay for GetSocial?**

In your billing area you have a ‘Select a plan’ menu where you can easily upgrade your plan.Paying for GetSocial is as simple as introducing a valid credit card in your billing area.
