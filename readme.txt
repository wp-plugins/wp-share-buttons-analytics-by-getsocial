Add social media sharing buttons from the most popular networks to track user activity, increase traffic, improve SEO, and follow conversions.

== Description ==
*GetSocial's* **Social Sharing Buttons & Analytics** is a free WordPress plugin that enables social sharing on your site.  These buttons not only allow your visitors to share your content, but they also track your users' actions such as how many shares have been made, how those shares are generating traffic to your site, and how that traffic is converting into more sales or subscriptions.

<h3>GetSocial works in four easy steps</h3>


<h4>1. Enable Social Sharing and Increase your SEO ranking</h4>


* **Custom Action Buttons**: Create your own sharing buttons, with unique expressions, sizes, and colors.
* **Social Sharing Bar**: Define which social networks you want your users to share your content and start understanding their behavior.
* **Classic Share Buttons**: Upgrade your existing social buttons with a simple snippet that will help you identify your traffic.


<h4>2. Collect user data through your share buttons</h4>


* **Users Analytics**: Get user data such as name, gender, location, and contact information and see how many visits, page views, and actions they have made.
* **Posts Analytics**: See how many unique visitors, page views, and shares have taken place in each item.
* **Shares Analytics**: Understand which social sharing buttons are the most popular and how many leads they are generating.


<h4>3. Analyze your data: identify opportunities, influencers, and conversions</h4>


* **Opportunities**: Find out who is most active on each of your product pages and then contact them directly to close the sale.
* **Influencers**: See who is your most influential user and how many leads and conversions they generate for your page.
* **Conversions**: Identify which users, products, and sharing buttons are most effective for increasing conversions through social sharing.


<h4>4. Engage: Export the data you collected and use it with your current marketing tools</h4>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<h4> What is a custom action? </h4>
A custom action is a button placed in your website that, when clicked, will create and post contextualized Facebook stories in your users' timelines.

<h4> Which data will I get from your analytics? </h4>
You'll have access to data regarding users, visits, shares and items (this can be products, news articles, blog posts, etc).  You can even download the whole data set generated by GetSocial.

<h4> What is social influence analysis?</h4>
Our influence analysis allows our clients to understand how their website is being impacted per user, per item, or per share. This means that it's simple to know, for instance, which user brought more new users into your website, which item brought in more page views or which share type generated more unique visitors

<h4> Why should I use these buttons instead of the ones provided on Facebook? </h4>
Today, Facebook buttons are simply buttons with counters. The data and value you get from them are purely the number of shares. However, you don’t know who’s sharing or how they are interacting with your site.  Instead, you just know how many people shared something. GetSocial provides you with not only these buttons, but also the social analytics that will help you understand your users and grow your business.
