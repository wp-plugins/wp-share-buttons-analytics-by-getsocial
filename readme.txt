== Upgrade Notice ==

== Description ==

**Share Buttons & Analytics by GetSocial** is a free WordPress plugin that enables trackable social sharing on your site. Supporting shares in over 10 major social networks, it allows your visitors to share your content, but they also track their actions such as how many shares have been made, how those shares are
generating traffic to your site, and how that traffic is converting into more sales or subscriptions.

Our product consists of:

<h4>Social Apps</h4>

In our appstore you'll find all the tools that you need to provide a way for your users express themselves and drive more traffic to your website. There are three tools you can use to achieve this goal:

* Custom Sharing Actions: Sometimes we need to say more than a simple 'Like'. Here you'll find more than 50 custom stories such as Awesome, Wish or Love.
* Horizontal Sharing Bar: Use one of our templates or design your own social sharing bar. Customize size, shape & color.
* Floating Sharing Bar: Left or right, provide an easy way for your users to share your content. Customize size, shape & color.
* Native Sharing Bar: It doesn't get much more classic than this. Your native sharing buttons with tracking abilities. Great for those who want to keep it real.

<h4>Analytics</h4>

Every app that you install has analytics attached to it. In this new era of information, no one is able to ignore all the data that goes and comes from the social media networks.
Our analytics will present to you the most influential users, the most shared content, and the social networks that drive your business.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is GetSocial Free?**

Yes. Most of our apps are free. You can upgrade to our Pro Plan ($9/month) for enhanced experience, such as mobile web sharing, white-labeling and custom actions.

**Why install GetSocial?**

We’ve tracked more than 50 million users in thousands of websites. We know that social users rock! On average, they perform 6x more pageviews and 3x more visits than the non-social users. It’s our mission to help you increase the number of social users in your site, thus generating more and highly qualified traffic.

**What is a custom action?**

A custom action is a button placed in your website that, when clicked, will create and post contextualized Facebook stories in your users' timelines.

**Which data will I get from your analytics?**

You'll have access to data regarding users, visits, shares and items (this can be products, news articles, blog posts, etc).  You can even download the whole data set generated by GetSocial.

**What is social influence analysis?**

Our influence analysis allows our clients to understand how their website is being impacted per user, per item, or per share. This means that it's simple to know, for instance, which user brought more new users into your website, which item brought in more page views or which share type generated more unique visitors

**Why should I use these buttons instead of the ones provided on Facebook?**

Today, Facebook buttons are simply buttons with counters. The data and value you get from them are purely the number of shares. However, you don’t know who’s sharing or how they are interacting with your site.  Instead, you just know how many people shared something. GetSocial provides you with not only these buttons, but also the social analytics that will help you understand your users and grow your business.
