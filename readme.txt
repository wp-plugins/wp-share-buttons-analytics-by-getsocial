**FREE Plan﻿:** If you're using our free plan, your limit is 50,000 visits per month. Once you reach this limit you'll be notified via email. If you don't upgrade to a paid plan, we'll stop the service to your website. This means that all the apps you have installed will become inactive.

﻿**Starter Plan﻿:** The Starter plan has a higher limit and can get up to 25,000 visits per month. After reaching this limit we'll charge $5 for every 25,000 new visits.

**What is different about GetSocial to other plugins and tools?**

From the feedback we've been receiving from our thousands of users, people join GetSocial for its design, easy installation and in-depth analytics. Our easy to user interface allows you to install our social media tools with no code required in just seconds, it's that easy. You also gain a simple to read dashboard with social analytics about your website.

**How do I upgrade and pay for GetSocial?**

Upgrading your GetSocial account is quick and easy. On your account, you'll find multiple times our 'Upgrade Plan' call to action buttons.

Clicking on one of these buttons will guide you to our pricing page. Here, you'll be able to perceive the benefits of subscribing to our pro plan.

After you have decided which plan you want to subscribe to (we recommend the Annual plan as it provides with 2 months free as discount), you just need to click on upgrade and provide your billing details.

**What is the Copy Paste Share Tracking?**

If you imagine the last times you shared something, it's probable that you haven't done so by clicking on a share button. If you're sharing a video to a friend or sending a link via email, you're sharing something and normally that doesn't get measured.

What happens is that you'll have these people being identified as 'direct' traffic to your website. They're not. The Address Bar feature allows you to track dark social sharing, which is sharing via alternative methods such as Copy&Paste, chats and link sharing in general.

**How can I edit color, shape and twitter handle?**

Editing color, shape and twitter handle is a customization available only to our paid users. By activating it, all these configurations become available, improving your conversions, awareness & reach. The features where you can edit these configurations are:

- Horizontal Shares Bar
- Horizontal Follow Bar
- Floating Shares Bar
- Floating Follow Bar
- Total Shares Bar (Horizontal + Floating)
- Mobile Share Bar
- Mobile Follow Bar
- Image Sharing

**Can I hide GetSocial in specific posts / pages?**

Yes you can! When you edit your post/page in the right sidebar you have an option to hide the social horizontal bars ( this does not include the mobile bar ). There’s an article on our knowledge base about this: <a href="http://feedback.getsocial.io/knowledgebase/articles/566541-can-i-exclude-apps-from-specific-pages">Can I exclude apps from specific pages?</a>

**Do I need to sign a long-term contract?**

Absolutely not! There are no contracts. Pay monthly, cancel anytime. There are no initiation fees, cancellation costs, license fees or any other charges. If you no longer wish to use GetSocial, you can cancel at any time. At that point, your paid subscription will last until the end of the current monthly billing cycle.
