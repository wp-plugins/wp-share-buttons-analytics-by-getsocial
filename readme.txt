== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is GetSocial Free?**

Yes. Most of our apps are free. You can upgrade to our Pro Plan ($9/month) for enhanced experience, such as mobile web sharing, white-labeling and custom actions.

**Why install GetSocial?**

We’ve tracked more than 50 million users in thousands of websites. We know that social users rock! On average, they perform 6x more pageviews and 3x more visits than the non-social users. It’s our mission to help you increase the number of social users in your site, thus generating more and highly qualified traffic.

**What is a custom action?**

A custom action is a button placed in your website that, when clicked, will create and post contextualized Facebook stories in your users' timelines.

**Which data will I get from your analytics?**

You'll have access to data regarding users, visits, shares and items (this can be products, news articles, blog posts, etc).  You can even download the whole data set generated by GetSocial.

**What is social influence analysis?**

Our influence analysis allows our clients to understand how their website is being impacted per user, per item, or per share. This means that it's simple to know, for instance, which user brought more new users into your website, which item brought in more page views or which share type generated more unique visitors

**Why should I use these buttons instead of the ones provided on Facebook?**

Today, Facebook buttons are simply buttons with counters. The data and value you get from them are purely the number of shares. However, you don’t know who’s sharing or how they are interacting with your site.  Instead, you just know how many people shared something. GetSocial provides you with not only these buttons, but also the social analytics that will help you understand your users and grow your business.
